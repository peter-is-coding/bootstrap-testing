# Bootstrap Testing

This repository is to test out Bootstrap as a CSS framework, rather than creating CSS from scratch - which is what I've been doing up until this point.

## Notes

- Have created a template locally that contains the boilerplate for bootstrap, though it would be better to include the files directly for any production site, this will get a new site up and running quickly (which is likely what I'll use this for)
- There's decisions to be made when using the framework as to what is styled using the built in bootstrap classes, or to just use custom CSS. Will look into if there is consensus on this in the docs or elsewhere.
